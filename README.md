# CyroRPG
A text-based RPG made in mostly C. Challenge from https://www.daniweb.com/programming/software-development/threads/67837/c-c-faq-s-and-practice-problems#post653516

Progress: As of https://github.com/NanoCode012/CyroRPG/commit/f1cc304935d880fda25933ce05e8c969514d3bf9 (7/Apr/2018), everything is playable, although there are certain features I have not enabled yet, and the game is still unpolished.
