# CyroRPG
A text-based RPG made in mostly C. Challenge from https://www.daniweb.com/programming/software-development/threads/67837/c-c-faq-s-and-practice-problems#post653516

Progress: Not yet finished core game, there will be bugs if cloned, until I specify a certain point at which it's barely ready.
